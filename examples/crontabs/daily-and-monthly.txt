# Crontab to take daily and monthly snapshot taking advantage of the branched
# feature so that the maximum chain lenth is 12+30=42 on December 31st.
# It tries to optimize the cost of storage assuming you delete old epochs on
# the 4th of each month, taking into account early deletion fees.
# It also assumes that none of these operations take more than 24h and that
# 2100GMT is the beginning of your "quiet" hours.

#
# You if you rely on emails to monitor failures, you could wrap all these
# commands with https://habilis.net/cronic/ to avoid sending emails on success
